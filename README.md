# Intelligent Surveillance Support System using Machine Learning
In past few decades we have seen an increase in the usage of surveillance systems such 
as CCTVs and portable monitoring devices. These are static but not intelligent. With 
the advent of Artificial Intelligence, frameworks like Computer Vision has increased the 
scope of including additional functionalities. This Intelligent Surveillance Support 
System adds to the conventional monitoring system with advanced real time features 
such as face recognition, alarm on theft/cheating detection, visitors in/out detection and 
motion detection. Emphasis is on doing the tasks mentioned above in real time. This is 
achieved by using optimised algorithms available in OpenCV Library which improves 
the usage of machine perception.


This is a tkinter gui app for converting your normal laptop camera to smart camera.

you just need to run main.py file inorder to run full app 

you would need :
opencv
tkinter

installed to run these scripts properly

thanks ;)

# Intelligent Surveillance Support System using Machine Learning
In past few decades we have seen an increase in the usage of surveillance systems such as CCTVs and portable monitoring devices. These are static but not intelligent. With the advent of Artificial Intelligence, frameworks like Computer Vision has increased the scope of including additional functionalities. This Intelligent Surveillance Support System adds to the conventional monitoring system with advanced real time features such as face recognition, alarm on theft/cheating detection, visitors in/out detection and 
motion detection. Emphasis is on doing the tasks mentioned above in real time. This is achieved by using optimised algorithms available in OpenCV Library which improves 
the usage of machine perception.

How It Works:-

1.You just need to run main.py file in order to run full app.

2. Real-Time Video Input:
The system utilizes the camera of your laptop and converting to smart camera. It captures a continuous stream of video frames in real-time.
3. Graphical User Interface (GUI):
The GUI built using tkinter provides a user-friendly platform to interact with the system's features. The GUI displays various buttons for different functionalities like Motion Detection, Rectangle Noise, Real-Time Noise, In-Out Detection, Real-Time Recording, Exit, Face Recognition and Identification. Each button is working different functionality.
